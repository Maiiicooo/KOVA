What is KOVA?

KOVA is a digital outdoor utility focused on discovering chill spots and providing weather information for hikers and adventurers. It’s an app/website that combines map data with local spots and weather updates, helping users plan their outings smarter and more enjoyably.

Why KOVA?

The idea behind KOVA comes from personal experience: many great outdoor spots are hard to find, and the weather can suddenly change everything. KOVA brings these two elements together: spots and weather.

Purpose of KOVA

Spot discovery: users can add, view, and explore chill spots via an easy-to-use map.

Weather utility: real-time weather information to plan your trips and activities effectively.

User-friendly and clear: everything in one interface, without distractions.

Community-driven: spots are submitted by users and only become visible after approval, ensuring quality and reliability.

Vision

KOVA aims to make outdoor experiences more accessible. Not just following routes, but finding the places you really want to be, with confidence in the weather and a safe, pleasant environment. It’s a combination of exploration, convenience, and reliable information.
